# Parodos Workflow Service

This service is designed run Parodos Workflows (composed of Parodos WorkflowTasks) created using the Parodos Model API.

## Starting The Service Locally

To compile all the components required for this project to work run the maven parent pom in the root directory of the
service folder.

```shell

mvn clean package

```

Note: It is assumed 'mvn install' has already been executed at the root level of the project to generate the WorkEngine
dependencies into your local maven repository. If this has not been completed the workflow-service will not compile.

The 'workflow-examples' dependency can be found in the pom.xml of the workflow-service. This is a demo configuration to
test the service. It should be removed once actual Tasks and WorkFlows start getting created.

To start the application run the following from the root folder of 'workflow-service'.

```shell
VERSION=1.0.3-SNAPSHOT
java -Dspring.profiles.active=local \
     -Dloader.path=../workflow-examples/target/workflow-examples-${VERSION}-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
     -jar target/workflow-service-${VERSION}.jar
```
or
```shell
VERSION=1.0.3-SNAPSHOT
export LOADER_PATH=../workflow-examples/target/workflow-examples-${VERSION}-jar-with-dependencies.jar
export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=local
java -jar target/workflow-service-${VERSION}.jar
```
Where the LOADER_PATH is the path to the jar containing the WorkFlowTasks and WorkFlows to be loaded into the service.

For convenience there is a shell script at the root of the folder that will run this command as well 
(`start_workflow_service.sh`).

The 'local' is intended for local testing and runs the application without security (Keycloak managed Oauth2 flow is the
default). Documentation is currently being produced for production grade security configurations.

## Defining Workflows And WorkFlowTasks

More detail on this subject will be covered in the 'parodos-model-api' folder of this project. For a complete example
please review 'workflow-example'.

In this present release teams are encouraged to think of Workflows and WorkflowTasks as stand alone Java projects. As
such they should have test coverage, undergo a full software release cycle and should not be updated in production
trivially. Due to the persistence of both workflow definitions and WorkflowTask executions, the workflow-service can be
restarted to update the definition of Workflows and WorkflowTasks.

**Note:** Future release of this service will include WorkFlowTask/WorkFlow creation/configuration options that do not
require having to write Java code.

## Loading WorkFlows into the Application

The Workflow Service is designed out-of-the-box to detect and load the WorkFlows using an implementation of
WorkFlowRegistry.

```java

public interface WorkFlowRegistry<T> {

    Set<T> getRegisteredWorkFlowNames();

    Map<T, WorkFlow> getAllRegisteredWorkFlows();

    WorkFlow getWorkFlowById(T id);

    Collection<T> getRegisteredWorkFlowNamesByWorkType(String typeName);
}

```

The BeanWorkflowRegistryImpl will load all Spring Beans of type: com.redhat.parodos.workflows.workflow.WorkFlow into the
registry which will in turn make them available for their respective Services (they must be in the package '
com.redhat.parodos' to be detected). WorkflowTasks and Workflows can be created using @Bean and @Configuration
annotations of the Spring Framework.

This can be done as part of the workflow-service's code base, or in a separate Jar that can add to the class path of the
workflow-service.

Please review the Parodos project 'workflow-examples' for more details.

## Service Endpoint Overview

Swagger can be accessed when running locally with http://localhost:8080. The username/password of test/test will grant
access locally.

## Service Endpoints

The workflow-service provides the following endpoints:

***Projects***

- GET  http://localhost:8080/api/v1/projects - Gets all the projects being managed with the workflow-service. Workflows
  act upon Projects
- POST  http://localhost:8080/api/v1/projects - Create a new Project
- GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/projects/{projectId} - Gets a specific Project reference

***Workflow***

- POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/workflows - Used to execute a Workflow

***Workflow Definition***

- GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/workflowdefinitions - Gets all the workflow definitions (this is the metadata of a
  Workflow and includes associated WorkflowTasks and WorkflowParameters)
- GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/workflowdefinitions/{workflowId} - Gets a specific workflow definition (this is the
  metadata of a Workflow and includes associated WorkflowTasks and WorkflowParameters)

## FAQ

### Why doesn't the service use a more mature/feature rich Business Rules engine?

It is assumed that Parodos will be running in enterprise environments where there will be many tools and platforms
available. As a result Parodos has not interested in trying to compete with such tools. The approach is to send the
appropriate data to these existing tools, and the most appropriate time to allow for them to be more effectively used
and integrated with other tools.

### These workflows are not advanced enough for me to perform the automation tasks I need. Will more automation features be added to Parodos?

If you are finding Parodos's simple workflows not advanced enough to manage the creation and configuration of your tools
you are not using Parodos in its intended purpose. Automation tools such as Ansible or Terraform should be used to
manage the creation and update of infrastructure. Tools such as Jira Service desk should manage permission
workflows. Think of Parodos as a way to tie these disparate systems together for a more comprehensive experience for
consumers of the tools. If you are lacking such automation and tools, it might not be the right time for you to use
Parodos

### Will there be support to configure rules beyond Spring Beans?

Yes. In this first release a configuration pattern widely used across many enterprise environments was chosen. However,
future release will include a DSL (domain specific language) for configuring Workflows without have to write Java code.

### How to configure my postgres database?
Make sure your database supports password authentication.
Create a database in postgres named `workflow_service`:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE workflow_service;
CREATE USER parodos WITH PASSWORD 'parodos';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE workflow_service TO parodos;
```

Before starting the `workflow-service` application, set the following environment variables for the database:
```
export DATASOURCE_URL="jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/workflow_service"
export DATASOURCE_DRIVER="org.postgresql.Driver"
export DATASOURCE_USERNAME="parodos"
export DATASOURCE_PASSWORD="parodos"
```

### How to configure my workflow configuration class in different package?
the environment variable for workflow configuration in different package:
* CONFIGURATION_PACKAGE

example: 
```
export CONFIGURATION_PACKAGE=org.test.*
```

for multiple packages:
```
export CONFIGURATION_PACKAGE=org.test.*,dev.test2.*
```
