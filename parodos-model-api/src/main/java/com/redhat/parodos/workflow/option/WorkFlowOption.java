/**
 * An WorkFlowOption is an identifier for a collection of @see WorkFlowTasks that can be
 * presented to a user as an option to choose from.
 * <p>
 * WorkFlowOption contains both the information to be displayed to the User to determine
 * if they want to select the WorkFlow, and also the information to execute the WorkFlow
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * workFlowId: unique identifier for this Workflow option. An example could be
 * platformname + workflowName (ie: AwsOcpAnsibleSelfHealingV1). This should correspond to
 * the value the workflow-service end points expect to execute a Workflow
 * <p>
 * name: a readable/user-friendly label for the WorkflowOption
 * <p>
 * description: a high level description related to the WorkflowOption
 * <p>
 * details: a collection of strings that can provide optional details (i.e: internal
 * charge back for the tooling to be stood up)
 * <p>
 * As much of this information is already required for the @see WorkFlowDefinition, this
 * object is leveraged to reduce having to specify the same information in two different
 * places
